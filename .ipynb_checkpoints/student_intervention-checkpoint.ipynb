    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Decision Trees**_: Decision trees are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms available.  An example of decision trees being utilized in the real world is found here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASP..107..279S.  In this publication, decision trees were used in order to filter noise out in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.  Decision trees perform well in most situations, and are able to deal with continuous and discrete data.  They also offer the flexibility of adding new scenarios, so they would perform well in a situation where new data or perhaps new features are constantly added.  Furthermore, the logic of decision trees is intuitive and easy to understand.  However, decision trees can grow quite fast, and calculations can get quite complex rather quickly and become computationally expensive.  Also, as more features and possible scenarios are accounted for, the decision tree often becomes more likely of overfitting.  I believe this to be a good canditate for the problem because the classification is binary.  Also, with a large amount of features, there are likely many combinations that can lead to the same classification.  A decision tree will allow for accounting for many of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**SVM**_: Support Vector Machines are another popular algorithm.  They can be used in facial classification as they are here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EFDF6B9D801D41B5BE6BA65440A8583A?doi=10.1.1.309.1707&rep=rep1&type=pdf.  In this example, SVM's were used together with a statistical model called the Facial Expression Shape Model(FESM) to classify facial expressions.  SVM's do very well with separating data that is both linear and non-linear, thanks to the kernel trick.  If the data is split by a non-linear boundary, the SVM will be able to efficiently transform the data in order to find an optimal boundary between the two different classes. However, the downside is that this process can be computationally intense.  Nonetheless, SVM's tend to also be robust to overfitting with careful choice of parameters.  However, If a bad choice of parameters is used, then the model is at risk of being too specific to the training data.  SVM's also don't perform well when the proportion of data points in the classes is unbalanced, or when there are multiple classes.  It is because of this I believe this to be a good candidate algorithm.  There are only two classes, and the distribution of the data is likely balanced (67% passed in the training data).  Also, depending on the data, SVM's would allow the flexibility to account for complex relationships and classify points accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Random Forests**_: Random Forest is an example of an ensemble methods that builds upon the decision tree algorithm.  Random forest can be applied to many of the same problems that decision trees can.  A specific example can be found here: http://epubl.ltu.se/1653-0187/2008/014/LTU-PB-EX-08014-SE.pdf.  In this experiment, random forests were utilized in order to determine whether a customer will respond positively to a new promotion or offer.  A large benefit of random forests is that they inherit all the benefits of the decision tree algorithm and (being a boosting method) improve on the original algorithm's accuracy.  They are efficient working with large datasets and can also achieve accuracy working with small datasets containing many features.  They are also robust against overfitting.  This algorithm is not fit for use with a continuous target variable, and are often slower when making predictions after they are trained.  There is also a danger of overfitting when the values in the training data set happen to be too unique or rare.  I believe this to be a good candidate for many of the same reasons I believe the decision tree algorithm is.  Using this algorith has the added benefit of higher accuracy and improvement than the decision tree algorithm."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",

    "For this situation, I chose using a Support Vector Machine algorithm.  The first reason for this choice is that I determined that accuracy of the model's prediction was more important than the training and predicting time of the model, and the support vector machine algorithm performed best overall in this regard.  Moreover, not much performace is lost as the dataset is relatively small.  Also, the accuracy of the model on the SVM training and test sets is close, whereas the respective accuracies of random forest and decision tree algorithms differ greatly.  This may suggest that the latter heavily overfitted to the training data, and is not as robust to this as SVM.  It may also be a sign that there are complex, non-linear relationships between the data that decision trees and random forests can't account for.  SVM's, however, have a special method to account for such relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, SVM's are built for binary classification and handle data with many features especially well.  Algorithms such as decision trees are at high risk of overfitting when the number of features is also high (48 in this case).  Higher accuracy with these algorithms may mean removing some features.  However, with careful choosing of parameters, SVM can keep all features involved and have low risk of overfitting."

    "The model will attempt to split the data into two different classifications: 'passed' and 'didn't pass'.  It will plot the data points accordingly, and look for the best boundary with which to separate the two classifications.  This boundary can be in many different shapes, and as such can account for unusual patterns in the data.  Once this boundary is determined, when a new data point is entered, it will be classified into one of the two categories based on which side of the boundary it falls on.  Using this classification, it can then be determined whether a current student is on their way to failing and whether they need intervention on not.\n",

With this method, the graph is transformed into a 3D shape, and a plane is used to split the points rather than a straight line.  A visualization of this is shown below.  Through the use of these processes, SVMs will find the best way to separate the data so that students are classified into the correct category."

    "The F1 score of the tuned model was increased about 2% from the untuned model with 300 samples.  The final F1 scores of the training and test sets also moved very close together after tuning.  Grid searching using other kernels (such as poly) resulted in either code cells stalling or lower accuracy when they did run.  Using an rbf kernel with the parameters chosen, the code was run quickly without losing accuracy.  When the search space for parameters C and Gamma was increased or decreased from the ones used above, the model became less accurate.  Because of these reasons, this model appears to be the optimal model."
